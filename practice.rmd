### *Design & Engineering Work*

#### ARC-CAVE 

**Work Type:** Engineering / Consulting

**Work Status:** Currently Underway

**Summary:** 

Starting in August of 2020 I joined a team of engineers at the University of Michigan's automotive research center with the goal of integrating human subjects into a autonomous driving simulation platform. This platform was original built as an HiL simulator and is now being expanded for the inclusion of a human subjects branch. My team is currently focusing on three different thrust areas. These thrust areas are:

1. Establish physiological sensors to gather useful data from human subjects related to workload, situational awareness, and similar metrics.
2. Establish the ability of the human actor to interface with the virtual world via a simulated vehicle cab and VR headset. 
3. Establish bi-directional communication modalities such as touch, voice, and physical signaling between the virtual agents and the humans in the simulator.

#### ARC Next Generation HiL Simulatior 


**Work Type:** Engineering / Consulting

**Work Status:** Contract Fulfilled

**Summary:** 

In 2019 I spent 3 months or so working with the automotive research center at the University of Michigan to design a hardware-in-the-loop simulator that functions as a means to test algorithms and differed types of self-driving technologies before putting them into physical environments. The simulator was originally intended as an in-between testing device that can use real-world hardware (including its various limitations) to assess this functionality.The simulator has since evolved and broadened its scope to be a general purpose research tool for the entire ARC rather than just the algorithmic development aspects of the center.
