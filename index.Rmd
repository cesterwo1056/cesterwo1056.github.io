### *About Me*

<img src="images/Self.jpg" style="width:25%; border:5px solid; margin-right: 20px" align="left">


I am a current Ph.D. student in the school of information at the University of Michigan. I focus my studies on the relationships between humans and machines. In particular, I study the effect of **trust** and **trust repair**. 

In short, robots will make mistakes eventually and in doing so will jeopardize the trust that human's have in them. How do they recover form this violation and what is the best way to do so? Does it make a difference if they look or act human? Does the type of violation matter? These are all questions I'm interested in and examine in my past and present research stream.
